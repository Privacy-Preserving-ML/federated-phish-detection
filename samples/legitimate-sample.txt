Subject: pac reminder
last month you received an email about enrolling in the enron pac . the
response has been positive .
thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your
current contribution !
if you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site , please
consider taking a moment to do so . the link to the website is at the end of
this message .
some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling .
we apologize for any trouble that you may have had . the enrollment works
best in either internet explorer or netscape . the most frequent problems
were a result of the lotus notes web browser that many employees have
installed as a default browser . if this is your case , please copy and paste
the link at the end of this message into either internet explorer or netscape .
as a reminder - following is the original message regarding the pac
enrollment :
last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to
become a " million dollar pac " . enron employees , who provide all of the
funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,
becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new
challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal
employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please
join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution .
